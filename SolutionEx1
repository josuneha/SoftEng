# Solution Exercise 1



# Product edition
We want to include further information in the  ProductEdit Servlet such as :  CategoryId, QuantityPerUnit, UnitsInStock and UnitsOnOrder. To do so, you should include these fields as attributes in ProductData class, in addition to add a new constructor and a new method to get this information from the database. 
Once you have made changes in this class, you should make changes in ProductEdit servlet so that you can show in the table the new fields: CategoryId, QuantityPerUnit, UnitsInStock and UnitsOnOrder.
If you want to update some of these values in the database, the changes will be saved in the servlet ProductUpdate.java.


This is a guide to understand what you need to do in this exercise. 
If you start the application and go to ProductList Servlet, you will see the list of products as you see in the following picture.
